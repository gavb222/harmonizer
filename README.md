# harmonizer
This repository contains c code for a version of a MIDI based harmonizer that reads in a microphone signal and MIDI information, and recreates the formants generated by the microphone signal (i.e. voice) at the pitches specified by the MIDI information. 
Currently, the harmonizer runs for 20 seconds or so, and then turns off. This will change in future versions, but as this is a proof of concept, this is the method by which I have decided to go for now.
